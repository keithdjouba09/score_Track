OS	: windows 10

Platform that coded on:
	Visual Studio 2015 (32-bit)
Special need to compile : appropiate extra libraries and header files will compile

Bugs	:
	1) Error message when entering input
	2) program incomplete



How I approached the problem :

	Code Flow:

	1) c++ code wich user will prompt the SQL
	2) Checking the sample SQL connector
	3) I tested the localhost
	4) sending queries to server and getting reply from it
	4) I'll tried to run the file on a compiler ONLINE but #include <cstdio> crashed the compiler
